Megacorporations like Google and Meta have\n\nstrategically convinced society to sign away their data and privacy, and so people today live\n\noblivious to the fact that they are being monitored at every instant, while the corporations get\n\nricher and more powerful. Also, Data breaches are an all too common occurrence these days,\n\nwith millions of people’s sensitive passwords in the hands of malicious entities. Because of all\n\nthese issues affecting today’s information-reliant society, government laws and regulations are\n\nrequired to protect the public from the danger megacorporations have put society in. In this\n\npaper, I will analyze and discuss what kind of laws I believe should exist to protect the data\n\nprivacy and anonymity concerns society has been facing and why I believe the laws are\n\nnecessary in relation to information theory and how humans make decisions.\n\nHumans make decisions based on the information they have and the information they\n\nexpect to receive. They also have preferences and values that influence their choices. People are\n\nnot always rational or consistent at all in their decision-making, they may be influenced by\n\nfactors such as biases, emotions, and social norms. There is also a wide range of how educated\n\nthe average person is on data security and privacy. Do they even know this is a serious problem?\n\nAccording to a report by Pew Research Center, “Americans are less knowledgeable about data\n\nprivacy laws today than in the past. Today, 72% of Americans say they have little to no\n\nunderstanding about the laws and regulations that are currently in place to protect their data\n\nprivacy. This is up from 63% in 2019. By comparison, the shares who say they understand some\n\nor a great deal about these laws decreased from 37% in 2019 to 27% in 2023.”1 This data clearly\n\nshows that the general public is not capable of governing itself and government action is\n\ndesperately needed. Laws and regulations are desperately required to defend the public from a\n\ndanger they are largely unaware of.\n\nTo ensure data privacy and security, detailed laws and regulations must be passed to\n\nregulate the collection, processing, and storage of personal information. These laws should\n\nmandate companies to obtain clear and obvious consent from people before collecting their data,\n\nensuring there is transparency about the purposes of data usage. Additionally, these laws should\n\nrequire the implementation of nearly impenetrable security measures to protect against data\n\nbreaches and unauthorized access. In 2023, new laws were passed in many states guaranteeing\n\nrights to individuals. These rights include: “the right to request access to inspect their personal\n\ninformation . . . the right to request that their personal information be deleted . . . the right to\n\ndecide whether their personal information may be sold or whether it may be used for purposes of\n\nreceiving targeted advertising . . . a guarantee that personal information should be used with\n\ninformed consent from the data subjects, in a way that is understandable to them, and only for\n\nlegitimate uses allowed under law, . . . and in the event of data breaches, a tested incident\n\nresponse plan should be in place to ensure that appropriate notifications can be delivered in a\n\ntimely manner.2 These were massive steps forward for the United States in regards to data\n\nsecurity and privacy. But this was only a select few states and more can still be done.\n\nIn today’s digital age, people are constantly at risk of having their identities\n\ncompromised. Anonymity protection laws are crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive\n\ndata that may greatly seep into personal lives. These laws should establish clear boundaries on\n\ndata retention periods, limiting the storage of personally identifiable information to the minimum\n\nnecessary for the intended purpose. Moreover, the laws should require organizations to adopt\n\ntechniques to dissociate data from individual identities, enhancing overall anonymity. The right\n\nto erasure is also crucial in addressing this issue. This means that individuals should be able to\n\nrequest the deletion of their personal data once it is no longer necessary for the purpose it was\n\ncollected for. This idea aligns with the concepts taught in information theory, which state that\n\ndata loses relevance over time, and retaining it unnecessarily poses an increased risk of privacy\n\ninfringement. There also should be laws that require organizations to provide clear and concise\n\ninformation regarding data collection practices. Individuals should be informed about the\n\nconsequences of sharing their data which allows them to make informed decisions. This is\n\nrelated to a concept in human decision-making, which states that individuals often make\n\ndecisions based on available information at their disposal. More information given to the\n\nindividual reduces entropy and therefore a more suitable and predictable decision is likely to be\n\nmade. Laws alone are insufficient without effective enforcement mechanisms. Stringent penalties\n\nfor non-compliance should be implemented to incentivize organizations to follow the data\n\nprivacy and protection regulations. This not only serves as a deterrent against negligent data\n\npractices but also reflects the importance society places on preserving individual privacy in the\n\ndigital scene.\n\nIn conclusion, the establishment of thorough laws and regulations to protect data privacy\n\nand anonymity is paramount in today’s digital landscape. The general public is still largely\n\nunaware of the danger they are in. Many do not know where their data is going and that it is\n\nfalling into malicious hands time and time again due to a lack of pressure on companies and data\n\nbreaches. This is why the government must take matters into its own hands and pass specific\n\nlaws and regulations to protect its people. These laws, which are grounded in information theory\n\nand human decision-making concepts, should address the collection, processing, and storage of\n\npersonal information. By incorporating provisions such as the right to erasure and ensuring that\n\ninformed decision-making is forced upon the public through transparency from the companies,\n\ngovernment regulations can effectively balance the need for innovation with the preservation of\n\nindividual privacy. These are the changes in laws and regulations that should exist to protect the\n\ndata privacy and anonymity concerns that megacorporations have placed upon today’s\n\ninternet-reliant society.\n\nReferences\n\n1. https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/views-of-data-privacy-risks-personal-d\n\nata-and-digital-privacy-laws/\n\n2.
