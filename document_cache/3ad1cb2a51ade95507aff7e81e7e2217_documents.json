Players can maneuver down the street using Google street view to gather as\n\nmuch information as possible. Once the player is ready they can select where they believe they\n\nare on a world map, and the closer they are, the more points they get. A perfect 5000 score\n\nrequires a player to guess within 100 meters of the exact location. Pinpoint accuracy is required\n\nto achieve such a score, narrowing down the entire planet to an exact street in any country. It is\n\nan extremely challenging and competitive game and therefore professional “geo-guessers” have\n\nrisen to form a tight knit community online. Posts from these pro geo-guessers where they\n\nshowcase their inhuman skill to the general public have gone viral on social media such as\n\nTwitter and TikTok. These players can figure out the exact location of an image in just a tenth of\n\na second, blowing the minds of millions of social media users. Using pattern recognition,\n\ngeographic knowledge, and application of information theory, pro geo-guessers are able to\n\nperform feats that may seem impossible to the casual player.\n\nOne of the main ways pro geo-guessers are able to figure out where they are so quickly is\n\npattern recognition. One might believe that painstakingly memorizing the entire planet is how\n\nthese pros accomplish their magic, but that isn’t true in the slightest. At its core, GeoGuessr is a\n\nvideo game, and there are many giveaways in the structure of the game. For example, one of the\n\nfirst things a pro geo-guesser looks at is the car carrying the Google camera. This seemingly\n\nirrelevant thing carries a treasure trove of information. The type of car and color of car are\n\ntelltale signs of certain geographic regions. The camera quality is another giveaway, some\n\ncountries have very high quality cameras while others are lower quality with visual glitches.\n\nAccording to vice.com, “Particularities of how and when the photo was taken can prove useful as\n\nwell. Street View only used black cars in three South American countries, and a glitch showing a\n\nview of the Google Car is rare in the U.S. but occurs more often in Canada. The quality of the\n\nphoto, which helps deduce which “generation” of Google Maps it’s associated with, can also\n\nhelp narrow down the list of possible countries as well,” (Strachan). Rather than relying on pure\n\nmemorization, these patterns allow for rapid and accurate decisions. These observations are the\n\nbiggest reason why these players are able to draw accurate conclusions within a fraction of a\n\nsecond. However, using patterns within the game is not always enough.\n\nBeyond pattern recognition, geo-guessers do have a much higher than average\n\nunderstanding of geography. This approach involves recognizing distinctive geographic features\n\nwithin the image. Viral content creator and professional geo-guesser “Rainbolt” said “He started\n\nto realize that he could tell he had seen a particular shade of grass in South Africa and particular\n\ntypes of soil in Nigeria,” (Strachan). For pro geo-guessers, geography is a complimentary layer\n\nto their analysis after patterns have whittled down most of the globe. Things such as the soil\n\ncolor, city layout, mountain ranges, and other nuances in a place’s geography are used greatly to\n\npinpoint an accurate location.\n\nInformation theory is a powerful tool for decoding locations in GeoGuessr. Central to\n\ninformation theory, entropy is the degree of randomness in a system. When a player enters a\n\nround, entropy is at its highest and it decreases as the player discovers clues in their\n\nsurroundings. GeoGuessr players look to maximize information gain by looking at things that\n\ndecrease entropy the most, such as the language of street signs or distinctive landmarks. A\n\ngeo-guesser skilled in information theory will be most efficient in narrowing down their location.\n\nThey also look for redundancy. This is when multiple clues join together to point to the same\n\nplace. This causes entropy to decrease and therefore the guess is more reliable. These are all\n\nways information theory is used by professional geo-guessers.\n\nAfter going through all the ways geo-guessers can pinpoint an exact location by looking\n\nat a still image for just one tenth of a second, it can seem alarming how much information\n\nseemingly innocent details in images contain.. This raises the issue of personal security and how\n\neasy it is to give oneself away online. It is extremely easy to give oneself away online. Consider\n\na simple post of someone in their backyard. At first glance, this seems like an inconsequential\n\npost. However, after remembering the skills of professional geo-guessers, this innocent post\n\nsuddenly becomes very revealing. Seemingly simple social media posts can easily be used by\n\nmalicious people with the same skill as these geo-guessers. A post in a backyard may seem\n\nharmless but someone with evil intent can find the exact location of where that photo was taken\n\nusing the color of the grass, terrain of the backyard, type of clouds in the sky, and many other\n\ngiveaways. All of these details combined can likely lead to a pinpoint location of that backyard,\n\nand therefore, that person’s address. Without even knowing it that person just exposed their\n\nhome address to the entire world. This realization is extremely important when living in today’s\n\nonline world. Anything about anyone can be found out through ways one can never imagine. Just\n\none person with ill intentions and some practice is all it takes to lose everything. Of course, there\n\nis not much one can do in this digital age, but being informed nonetheless is important.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nStrachan, Maxwell. “The Guy Who Memorized Google Maps Says You Can Too.” VICE, 9\n\nSept. 2022, www.vice.com/en/article/ake7a5/geoguessr-rainbolt-interview.",
